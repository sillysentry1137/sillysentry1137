- 👋 Hi, I’m @sillysentry1137
- ("Sentry" because I'm a cybersecurity student; "1/137" for Sommerfeld's fine structure constant)
- 👀 I’m interested in ethical hacking, pentesting, and security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build and debug small applications.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on any projects at the moment.
- 📫 There isn't any way to reach me for now, just enjoy my programs.
- 🖥️ I do my personal stuff (school, work) on an airgapped LFS desktop build.
- 💻 I build on a vBox instance of Windows Tiny11 on an Ubuntu host laptop.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I code side-by-side with my own personally trained local LLMs.
